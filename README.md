The purpose of this project is to build the best suited classifier model to classify 10 categories of grayscale fashion images: 
top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag and boot. The dataset used ‘train.csv’ is a subset of the 
original Fashion-MNIST dataset, it contains 30,000 examples of 28x28 sized images.
A ‘test.csv’ file with 5,000 images without labels was also used to assess model accuracy against the unit cohort
